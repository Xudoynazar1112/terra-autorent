              Top 3 Destinations to Visit in Dubai in a Rental Car

            <p className="text-start">
              One of the main reasons to hire a car in Dubai is the quality of
              the UAE roads. According to the World Economic Forum, the Emirates
              belong to the top seven countries with the most exemplary road
              infrastructure.

              Top 5 wonderful spots for a car photo session in Dubai
            </p>
            <p className="text-start">
              There are so many wonderful things to do in Dubai, but when you
              rent a car your opportunities are nearly doubled. The number of
              places you will die to go to and make memorable pictures is such
              that it makes you impossible to resist to hire a mode of
              transportation, if not for a day or two, then at least for a
              couple of hours. And, while doing so, who could prove against the
              weakness of taking a photo of themselves inside or near the car
              theyâ€™ve rented?
